# Software Architecture - Project
## Overview
You are going to design a software system that allows participation of data, analysis of data, and 
generating analysis report. The participation of data in the system is by both generating data and 
taking data from external sources. The number of participating sources of data may change at run 
time. The data analysis part of the system may then also change accordingly, i.e. new data analysis 
instances be created at run time. 
The following sections explain the different parts of the system.
1. Data Input Services (DIS)
2. Auxiliary Data Input Services
3. Change Detector Service (CDS)
4. Scoring Service (SS)
5. Reporter Service (RS)
6. Dynamic Service Generator Service (DSGS)
7. Code Supplier Service (CSS)
